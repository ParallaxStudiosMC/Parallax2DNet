# Parallax2DNet
A basic LiteNetLib wrapper allowing for easy and simple Peer to Peer (P2P) multiplayer servers!


# NOTE! This wrapper is designed around .NET 8.0, and works best with Parallax2D games. It may work with general C# games, but has not been tested.
# NOTE! .NET 8.0 is REQUIRED for use, just how .NET 8.0 is required for Parallax2D engine and all games made with it!
